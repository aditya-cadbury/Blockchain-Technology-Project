# Food Supply Chain DApp – Evaluation Document

This document maps the implementation to the evaluation criteria and provides evidence (files, features, tests) that demonstrate how the app meets each requirement. All paths are relative to the project root.

## 1) Uniqueness & Creativity 
- Concept: Consumer-trust focused provenance for perishable food (e.g., mangoes) with a scannable QR and transparent lifecycle.
- Differentiation:
  - Role-based lifecycle (Farmer → Shipper → Receiver) with immutable on-chain events, readable by anyone.
  - QR-driven “track by ID” flow enabling offline-to-online conversion at point-of-sale.
- Optional IPFS/Web3.Storage metadata (images, certifications) now implemented.
- Evidence:
  - Smart contract lifecycle and events: `contracts/SupplyChain.sol`
  - QR generation in UI: `frontend/app.js` (`generateQR()`)
  - Consumer-friendly tracking view: `frontend/index.html` → Track section

## 2) Smart Contract Quality, Security, Technical Robustness
- Secure design:
  - Strict state machine using `enum ProductState` and `require()` guards for every transition.
  - Minimal surface area: creation, shipping, receiving, with explicit role checks.
  - Owner-managed role assignments; no arbitrary state changes.
  - Events emitted for every lifecycle action for indexers/analytics.
- Patterns:
  - Checks-Effects-Interactions within single-contract state updates.
  - Reverts on invalid IDs, duplicates, and wrong states.
- Evidence:
  - Contract: `contracts/SupplyChain.sol`
  - Role management: `setFarmer`, `setShipper`, `setReceiver`
  - Events: `ProductCreated`, `ProductShipped`, `ProductReceived`
  - Tests verify revert cases, state correctness: `test/SupplyChain.t.js`

## 3) Functional Correctness, Performance, Scalability 
- Correctness:
  - Unit tests cover success and failure paths: creation, shipping, receiving, and invalid access/state.
  - ABI is written post-deploy; frontend reads current address (`frontend/abi.json`).
- Performance:
  - Optimizer on (Hardhat config) for gas efficiency.
  - Simple storage mapping for O(1) product reads.
- Reliability (new):
  - Minimum gas fee floor in UI (EIP-1559): `maxFeePerGas ≥ 2 gwei`, `maxPriorityFeePerGas ≥ 1 gwei` to avoid underpriced txs on variable RPCs during demos.
- Scalability:
  - Stateless reads via `getProduct` scale horizontally through RPC nodes/CDNs.
  - Events enable off-chain indexing (e.g., The Graph) for large datasets.
- Evidence:
  - Tests all pass locally: `npx hardhat test`
  - Config with optimizer: `hardhat.config.js`
  - Fee floor implementation: `frontend/app.js` → `feeOverrides()` applied in write calls
  - Deployment scripts: `scripts/deploy-local.js`, `scripts/deploy-sepolia.js`

## 4) User Experience (UX/UI), Documentation, Clarity 
- Modern UI:
  - Tailwind-based, responsive layout with glassmorphism cards and soft shadows.
  - Three.js animated background and Lucide icons for modern look and visual hierarchy.
  - Dark/Light mode toggle.
- Usability:
  - Clear forms for each role action and a dedicated tracking panel with JSON view.
  - Wallet connect button with robust provider detection, network auto-switch, and fee floors to reduce failed txs.
  - QR generation for product ID to simplify consumer access.
- Documentation:
  - `README.md` quickstart, structure, deploy instructions, and minimum gas policy.
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md` explains fee overrides and data flow.
  - This `EVALUATION.md` mapping to rubric.

## 6) IPFS/Web3.Storage integration
- IPFS/Web3.Storage integration implemented for product metadata.
  - Contract: `metadataCid` field, `setProductMetadataCid`, and `ProductMetadataUpdated` event.
  - Frontend: upload with Web3.Storage API token or paste CID; setter call wired.
  - Evidence: `contracts/SupplyChain.sol`, `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/app.js`.
- Oracle: Not implemented; documented as next step (see below).

## 7) ZK or NFT logic (if applicable)
- Not implemented; documented as optional extension (see below).

## Next Steps (Oracle, NFT/ZK)
- Oracle (Chainlink) integration to fetch external data (e.g., weather, shipment updates).
- NFT minting per product ID (ERC-721) with tokenURI pointing to IPFS metadata CID.
- Optional ZK example: proof-of-role to perform actions without revealing address mapping.

## 8) E2E Testing + Demo Prep
- E2E tests scaffolded using Playwright.
  - Config: `playwright.config.ts`
  - Test: `tests-e2e/basic.spec.ts`
  - Scripts in `package.json`: `test:e2e`, `test:e2e:headed`, `test:e2e:ui`
- Demo instructions in `README.md` updated for E2E.

## 5) Real-World Use Case, Adoption Potential
- Use Case:
  - Addresses real transparency needs in food supply chains; combats counterfeit claims; builds consumer trust.
- Adoption:
  - Low friction: scan QR → see provenance; no wallet required for viewing.
  - Role-based flows mirror real operations; minimal training required.
  - Fee floors reduce demo-time friction and underpriced txs, improving perceived reliability.
- Market Relevance:
  - Fits regulatory pushes for traceability in food and pharma; reusable pattern.
- Evidence:
  - QR → Tracking flow: `frontend/app.js` and `frontend/index.html`
  - Extensibility points documented in `README.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`

## How to Demo Quickly
1. Local node + deploy
   - `npx hardhat node`
   - `npm run deploy:local`
2. Serve UI
   - `npm run serve:frontend` → open `http://127.0.0.1:5180`
   - Connect MetaMask (Localhost 8545). Use owner account or assign roles.
3. Walkthrough
   - Create → Ship → Receive → Track → Generate QR

Fee floors are documented in `README.md` and implemented in `frontend/app.js`.
